## How to Build

1. Clone or download the repository to your local computer.

> git clone https://github.com/StarWishsama/Nameless-Bot.git

2. Compile

> Both configurations for Gradle and Maven are well done (when consider Gradle first when conflict.) Specifically for Gradle running on Windows, double-click `gradlew.bat` in the root directory to compile a jar file in folder `/build/libs`.
